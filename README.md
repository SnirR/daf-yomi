# Daf Yomi Tools 📜

A collection of Python tools for downloading, organizing, and formatting Hebrew Talmud pages for study and printing. Includes both command-line scripts and a modern web application with real-time progress tracking. Perfect for Daf Yomi learners who want to combine multiple pages into a single, printer-friendly document.

## 🎯 Features

### Web Application (New!)
- 🌐 **Modern Web Interface**: Easy-to-use Hebrew RTL web interface
- 🖨️ **Print by Page Count**: Ask for N printed pages instead of a daf range, and the app
  measures the real layout to pick how many amudim fit
- 📊 **Real-time Progress Bar**: See download progress and current page being processed
- 🔍 **Searchable Tractate Selection**: Type to search tractates (e.g., "ירו" finds "עירובין")
- 📁 **Informative Filenames**: Downloads have meaningful names like `avodah_zarah_71-76.html`
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Navigation**: Use arrow keys to increment/decrement page numbers
- ⚡ **One-Click Launch**: `./launch.sh` starts server and opens browser automatically

### Command Line Tools
- **Download Daf Yomi Content**: Fetch Hebrew Talmud pages directly from daf-yomi.com
- **Smart Page Combination**: Merge multiple HTML pages with proper Hebrew (RTL) formatting
- **Intelligent Sorting**: Automatically sorts pages by tractate, page number, and side (A/B)
- **Print-Optimized**: Creates printer-friendly documents with proper page breaks
- **Hebrew Number Support**: Full Hebrew numeral system support (ב to קע)
- **Tractate-Specific Tools**: Specialized combiners for different tractates

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Web Application (Recommended)

**Launch the web app:**
```bash
./launch.sh
```

This will:
- Start the Flask web server automatically
- Open your browser to http://localhost:5001
- Provide a modern interface for downloading Daf Yomi pages

**Using the web interface:**
1. **Select Tractate**: Type to search (e.g., "בבא" shows all בבא tractates)
2. **Choose Starting Daf**: Set the daf and amud to start from, using the arrows or arrow keys
3. **Choose Page Count**: Enter how many pages you want out of your printer, and the paper size
4. **Download**: Click "הורד דפים" and watch the real-time progress bar
5. **Get File**: Downloads automatically, containing exactly the amudim that fit in that many pages

### Option 2: Command Line Tools (Legacy)

See `cli-tools/README.md` for documentation on the original command-line scripts.

## 🛠️ Web Application Components

### `app.py`
Flask web server with real-time progress tracking and Hebrew interface.

**Features:**
- Server-Sent Events for progress updates
- Hebrew number conversion system
- Informative filename generation
- Automatic file cleanup

### `templates/index.html`
Modern Hebrew RTL web interface.

**Features:**
- Searchable tractate selection

## 📋 Requirements

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Required packages:**
  ```bash
  pip install requests beautifulsoup4
  ```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Hebrew Number Support
The scripts include comprehensive Hebrew numeral mapping:
- ב (2) through קע (170)
- Handles complex combinations like קיג (113), קכד (124)
- Automatic conversion for daf-yomi.com URL format

### File Organization
- Downloaded files are saved in the `pages/` directory
- Output files are created in the project root
- HTML files are automatically sorted by name

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Download Specific Pages
```python
# Modify download_daf_simple.py to download specific ranges
# Example: Download Berakhot pages 2-10
```

### Custom Combination
```python
# Use combine_pages.py for general combination
# Use combine_pages_with_titles.py for enhanced formatting
# Use combine_avodah_zarah.py for Avodah Zarah specific pages
```

### Print Settings
The web app asks for a starting daf and a number of printed pages, then picks the
end daf so the result fits in that many sheets. It downloads amudim from the start
point, lays them out in a hidden iframe sized to the exact printable area, and keeps
the longest run of amudim that stays within your target.

The generated file pins the paper size and margins with an `@page` rule, so the count
only holds if the print dialog keeps its defaults:
- Paper size matching the one selected in the app (A4 or Letter)
- Margins set to "Default" - the file supplies 12mm itself
- Scale at 100%

The reported count is exact in most cases. When the measurement is ambiguous the app
shows a range (for example `19-20`); the real total is never above the number you asked
for, and is occasionally one page below it.

## 🌐 Hebrew Text Support

This project is optimized for Hebrew Talmud text:
- **RTL (Right-to-Left) text direction**
- **Hebrew numeral system support**
- **Proper Unicode handling**
- **Print-friendly Hebrew formatting**
